# VHDL CPU Design

This repository contains a CPU designed and implemented in **VHDL**, showcasing core digital system design concepts including finite state machines, arithmetic logic units, instruction decoding, and seven-segment display interfacing. The project was developed as part of **COE328 ‚Äì Digital Systems Engineering** at Toronto Metropolitan University.

## üìñ Overview

The project integrates multiple digital subsystems into a functional CPU model:

- **Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs):** Three versions developed to perform arithmetic, logic, and control operations.
- **Control Unit:** A finite state machine (FSM) manages sequencing, input gating, and reset logic.
- **Instruction Decoder:** A 4-to-16 decoder generates one-hot signals to select ALU operations.
- **Registers & Storage:** Input registers hold data before processing, and latches manage state.
- **Output System:** Results are displayed on dual seven-segment displays in signed BCD format.

This project provided hands-on experience in **RTL design, FPGA implementation, and hardware simulation workflows**, bridging theory with practical engineering.
